                    <p>
                        For the safety of students and faculty, Johns Hopkins University made the tough decision to host a remote semester for the Fall of 2020. As such, all scholarly activities take place on a video platform with which we have become well-acquainted:
                        Zoom. As we've had to become very accustomed to this technology, we've also come to understand its shortcomings. 
                        We wish there were more practical feaures to ease the user experience, like minimizing the toolbar when sharing a screen, and in
                        some cases these features exist but are unintuitive to use. Considering this application is used on an almost daily basis and has proved difficult to master, we've set out to redesign 
                        the Zoom interface for a more streamlined and intuitive user experience.

                  <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
                    
                    <h4>STEP 1: User Research</h4>
                    <p>We brainstormed ways that we could improve remote scheduling and meetings, which resulted in three ideas. Based on these ideas, we created a survey that measured
                        JHU students' feelings and priorities when it comes to scheduling and attending virtual meetings.</p>
                    <h4>STEP 2: Low-fidelity prototype</h4>
                    <a href="#" class="center"><img src="images/lofi.jpg" alt="" style="width:850px;height:auto;"></a>
                        <p>The survey results informed the features that we should implement in our low-fidelity prototype. Once finished with this stage we each performed 1-2
                        contextual inquiries on our roommates. This first contextual inquiry proved successful, the only common issue that arose was hesitation in closing the "Options" button in student options; users expected to able to click anywhere
                        to exit from the tab rather than re-clicking the "Options" button. Taking the knowledge we gained from Contextual Inquiry, we turned this into a tangible Sequence Model using Miro and then set out to create our High Fidelity Prototype.

                  <h4>Step 3: Hi-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
                  <a href="#" class="center"><img src="images/hifi.jpg" alt="" style="width:850px;height:auto;"> </a>
                    <p>After succesfully testing our lo-fidelity prototype, we went on to work on creating a high-fidelity prototype, including all the changes from the contextual inquiry results. We polished up all windows and frames to showcase a much more
                      finished product. The hi-fidelity prototype enables us to test UI elements and specific interactions that would be
                      more akin to a fully-functioning end product. We made use of Google's Material Design research and elements from their <a href="https://www.figma.com/@materialdesign" target="_blank">Figma template </a> to combine the aesthetic of Google's design that is familiar to most
                      users with users' knowledge of navigating Zoom. Our enhancements to the user interface allowed our high-fidelity prototype to be more intuitive.
